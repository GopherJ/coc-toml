# coc-toml

toml client extension for coc-nvim
taplo is used to parse toml and taplo-lsp is used as language-server

## ! Important

This repo and package is alpha-version.

There are some bugs, unimplemented features, and documents missing,
though I'm making efforts to add them on it.

Also, issues and pull requests are all welcome. I'm a beginner in rust and ts.
So, tell me if I'm wrong or going to bad way to implement this.
